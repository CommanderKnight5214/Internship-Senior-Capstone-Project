# Internship/Senior Capstone Project

For this project, I helped to create an Internal Blazor Application for SKYGEN USA, which worked as an internal social media application for the company. The application itself utilized many of microsofts newest technologies such as blazor, as well as its old techologies such as ASP.NET along with .NET development as well. In addition to this, I also used SQL and C# throughout the duration of my internship, and I also got to use a learn and third party library called mudblazor. 

The project itself gave me some valuable experience, which not only consisted of some valuable industry experience, but this experience also gave me the opportunity to learn and grow as a software developer. I learned a lot of new tools and technologies while I was an intern at SKYGEN USA, and while I am not able to publish my code because it is properitary. I can say that this experience was valuable to me as a software developer, and this experience will only drive my furthern into working on my projects with these new technologies, while also learning some new technolgies at a future company.
